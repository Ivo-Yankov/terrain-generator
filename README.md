# Hex based terrain generator

![Terrain](http://i.imgur.com/eN5RdSb.png)

This is a simple random terrain generator that uses a hex based grid. Every object is a hexagon tile with a different color and height.

Right now there are 2 types of bioms - mountain and flat island. There are rivers flowing from the mountains and the higher tiles are covered in snow. Trees are spawned on the grass and mountain tiles.

# How to start it

```
npm install
```
```
gulp terrain
```

For now this doesn't serve any purpose but it looks cool :)
